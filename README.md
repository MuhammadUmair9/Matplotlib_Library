# Matplotlib Library - Graph Plotting Examples

This repository demonstrates how to use the `matplotlib` library in Python to plot various types of graphs. The following types of graphs are included:

1. **Multiple Line Plot**
2. **Scatter Plot**
3. **Bar Chart**
4. **Histogram**
5. **Pie Chart**
6. **Bubble Chart**
7. **Population growth plotting**
8. **student marks compersion**
9. **student bar chart**

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have `matplotlib` installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

You can find the Python scripts for each graph type in this repository. To use them, simply run the corresponding `.py` file:

### 1. **Multiple Line Plot**
   - **File**: `multiple_line_plot.py`
   - This script demonstrates how to plot multiple lines on the same graph.

### 2. **Scatter Plot**
   - **File**: `scatter_plot.py`
   - This script shows how to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two variables.

### 3. **Bar Chart**
   - **File**: `bar_chart.py`
   - This script demonstrates how to create a bar chart to compare different categories.

### 4. **Histogram**
   - **File**: `histogram.py`
   - This script shows how to create a histogram to display the distribution of a dataset.

### 5. **Pie Chart**
   - **File**: `pie_chart.py`
   - This script demonstrates how to create a pie chart to visualize proportions of categories.

### 6. **Bubble Chart**
   - **File**: `bubble_chart.py`
   - This script shows how to create a bubble chart to display three dimensions of data (x, y, and bubble size).

## Running the Scripts

To run a specific plot, navigate to the directory where the script is located and run:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For example, to run the multiple line plot script:

```bash
python multiple_line_plot.py
```

## Conclusion

This repository provides Python scripts for generating various types of plots using `matplotlib`. These visualizations can help you analyze and interpret your data in different ways.

Feel free to explore and modify the scripts to fit your data visualization needs!
