# Matplotlib Library - Graph Plotting Examples

This repository demonstrates how to use the `matplotlib` library in Python to create various types of data visualizations. It includes scripts for commonly used plots, which are useful in data analysis, reporting, and education.

---

## ✅ Graphs Included

1. **Multiple Line Plot** – `multiple_line_plot.py`  
2. **Scatter Plot** – `scatter_plot.py`  
3. **Bar Chart** – `bar_chart.py`  
4. **Histogram** – `histogram.py`  
5. **Pie Chart** – `pie_chart.py`  
6. **Bubble Chart** – `bubble_chart.py`  
7. **Population Growth Plotting** – `population_growth.py`  
8. **Student Marks Comparison** – `student_marks_comparison.py`  
9. **Student Bar Chart** – `student_bar_chart.py`

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have the necessary library installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

Each script is self-contained and can be executed individually. Navigate to the project directory and run the desired file:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

### Example:
```bash
python population_growth.py
```

## 📊 Plot Descriptions

| Script Name                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `multiple_line_plot.py`        | Plots multiple lines on a single graph.                                     |
| `scatter_plot.py`              | Creates a scatter plot to analyze relationships between variables.          |
| `bar_chart.py`                 | Compares different categories using bars.                                   |
| `histogram.py`                 | Shows the frequency distribution of a dataset.                              |
| `pie_chart.py`                 | Displays category proportions in a circular chart.                          |
| `bubble_chart.py`             | Represents three variables with x, y, and size as a bubble chart.           |
| `population_growth.py`         | Visualizes the growth of population over years.                             |
| `student_marks_comparison.py` | Compares student marks using a grouped or line chart.                       |
| `student_bar_chart.py`         | Shows individual student performance using a bar chart.                     |
